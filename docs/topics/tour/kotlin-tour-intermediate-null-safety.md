[//]: # (title: Intermediate Null safety)

In the beginner's tour, you learned how properties are used to declare characteristics of class instances and how to access
them. This chapter digs deeper into how properties work in Kotlin and explores other ways that you can use them in your code.

## Smart casts and safe casts

`is` `!is`

`as` `as?`

## Filter null values from collections

## Throw exceptions

Note that functions returning Nothing can be used on the right side of the Elvis operator to perform precondition 
checking (See Kotlin in Action). if it fails, an exception is thrown.

This unique type signals that a function will never successfully complete its execution and return a value. It means the
function will always throw an exception and prematurely terminate the control flow.
